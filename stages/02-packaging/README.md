# Packaging

## Overview

![Packaging Stage](images/packaging.svg)

In this stage the application is packaged for deployment and tested as a whole.

## Steps

The steps are:

1. packaging,
2. generate SBOMs,
3. component tests,
4. security checks, and
5. artifact signing

### Packaging

When deploying to a Container Plattform, this step includes a container build.

Only use signed and verified base infrastructure (e.g. base-images).

More details and tool suggestions: [packaging.md](packaging.md)

### Generate SBOMs

[Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)](https://www.ntia.gov/page/software-bill-materials) is a nested inventory for software, a list of ingredients that make up software components.

For Containers this list includes all software installed on the image and can also include all application third-party software. The list can be generated by image scanners.

### Component Tests

The goal is to check that all the units of the application work together as expected. External resources are simulated/mocked (e.g. with an in-memory database).

* run component tests

Testing guidelines: [test pyramid](../../best-practices.md#testing)

### Security Checks

Security scan of the deployable artifact.

This mostly only applies to container images.

More details and suggestions for tools: [security-checks.md](security-checks.md)

### Artifact Signing

Signing of all generated artifacts for later verification.

Artifacts to be signed:

* Container Images
* [Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)](https://www.ntia.gov/page/software-bill-materials)
* Attestation

## Stage Output

The output will be:

* a deployable artifact of the application (e.g. application container image), and
* test results.
